**How to use the Game Ordering Application**

USER:

As a user, when opening the application, you are welcomed by a screen that lets you select one of the 2 buttons: &quot;Register&quot; and &quot;Log In&quot;

- The application lets you create an account via &quot;Register&quot;, either as a shop manager or a simple client.

- To log in, a user (manager or client) inputs the credentials he used to make an account and if input correctly, he is sent to a new page. In case, the user mistypes the username and/or the password, a pop-up will appear saying the credentials are invalid, thus the user cannot log into the app.

SHOP Manager:

As a shop manager, after you logged in successfully, the page you have been forwarded to shows 2 different options: &quot;See Menu List&quot; and &quot;Check Client Orders&quot;.

- By clicking &quot;See Menu List&quot;, the manager can see all the products he has in his shop. He can also add more products or delete ones that are out of stock. Once changes are made and saved, he can return to the previous page by clicking &quot;Go back&quot;.

- By clicking the other button &quot;Check Game Orders&quot;, the app will display a new page, where a list of all orders from clients will be shown. Manager can accept or reject orders. When done with the orders, he can &quot;Go back&quot; to the previous page.

CLIENT:

As a client, once logged in successfully, the page you will be redirected to shows 2 options: &quot;See Stores&quot; and &quot;Check Game Orders&quot;.

- If the first option is selected (&quot;See Stores&quot;), a page with a list of all stores in the database of the app will be displayed. Client can find a shop by scrolling and then, by clicking on it, he can see what the shop has to offer. Once a shop was selected, the products from said shop will be displayed. A &quot;Buy product&quot; button will be displayed next to the product for the client to buy. If the client is done with looking through the products and maybe buying, he can go back to the previous page.

- By clicking &quot;Check Game Orders&quot;, the client can view a history of all the orders , in process or from the past. When the order eventually gets delivered, the client has the obligation to check a box with the word &quot;Delivered&quot; to let the manager the product was delivered safely. Client can go back to the previous page at will.
